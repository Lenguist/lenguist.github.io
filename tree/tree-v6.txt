Layer 1: College Majors / Fields
----------------------------------
Nodes:
  - Mathematics
  - Computer Science
  - Electrical Engineering
  - Mechanical Engineering
  - Computer Engineering
  - Artificial Intelligence

Connections:
  - No interconnections among these nodes.
  
Layout:
  - These nodes will be positioned as the top-level anchors, spaced widely apart.

--------------------------------------------------
Layer 2: Courses / Classes
--------------------------------------------------
This layer is divided into two sub-layers:

Sub-layer 2A: Foundational / Lower-Level Courses
--------------------------------------------------
Nodes:
  - Linear Algebra
  - Multivariable Calculus
  - Circuit Analysis
  - Transistors
  - Signals
  - Digital Logic
  - Analog Devices
  - Probability
  - C Programming / Low-Level Coding

Connections:
  - Each foundational course connects upward to its corresponding major in Layer 1.
  - Minimal lateral connections only to represent essential prerequisites 
    (for example, C Programming / Low-Level Coding may connect to Operating Systems below).

Layout:
  - Arrange these nodes in a clear horizontal row with ample spacing between each node.

Sub-layer 2B: Advanced / Specialized Courses
--------------------------------------------------
Nodes:
  - Operating Systems (OS)
  - Data Structures
  - Topics in Computer Science
  - Machine Learning
  - Parallel Optimization for Robotics
  - Computer Architecture
  - CAD
  - Mobile Robotics / SLAM (or an alternative name for advanced robotics/SLAM topics)
  - Robotics Iteration (to capture iterative robotics/advanced SLAM topics)

Connections:
  - Each advanced course connects upward to its relevant major in Layer 1.
  - Lateral connections represent prerequisite or dependency relationships, for example:
      • Linear Algebra, Probability, and Multivariable Calculus → Machine Learning.
      • C Programming / Low-Level Coding → Operating Systems.
      • Data Structures ↔ Topics in Computer Science.
  - These connections are kept minimal but clear to show progression.

Layout:
  - Position these nodes as a second horizontal row beneath the foundational courses.
  - Increase spacing between nodes to avoid overlap and ensure clarity.

--------------------------------------------------
Layer 3: Detailed Topics / Concepts
--------------------------------------------------
Nodes:
  (This layer is more free-form and less structured, capturing detailed ideas and methods from the courses)
  - Neural Networks
  - Clustering
  - Optimization Algorithms
  - Digital Circuit Design
  - Sensor Integration
  - Extended Kalman Filter (EKF)
  - Signal Processing Techniques
  - (Additional specific topics as needed)

Connections:
  - Each detailed topic node connects to one or more courses from Layer 2 that cover the subject.
  - These connections are more numerous and cross-disciplinary, emphasizing interdisciplinary links.

Layout:
  - Nodes in this layer will be distributed organically, allowing a more chaotic, networked feel.
  - Spacing will be increased to accommodate the density and avoid overlap.

--------------------------------------------------
Overall Spacing & Layout Considerations:
  - Increase horizontal and vertical spacing between nodes across all layers.
  - Ensure clear separation between layers while allowing connections to span layers.
  - Use a force-directed layout with customized forces to maintain the defined layer positions
    and to prevent text and nodes from overlapping.
