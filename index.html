            <p>Hi! I am Maksym, currently a Computer Engineering student at Columbia University,
                coming from Kyiv, Ukraine.
                I am passionate about AI, engineering of all kinds, startups and deep tech.
            <p>Every day I wake up, look around at the beauty of human civilization,
                and think to myself "how can we make it even better?" I belive one answer to this question
                is to enable more human productivity through expanding access to education, AI tools and mentorship.</p>
            <p>
                Previously, I have started <a href="https://www.pravopysnyk.com/">Pravopysnyk</a>, AI grammar correction service for Ukrainian.
                We built it while in high school, self-learning skills from full stack web dev to NLP along the way.
                Currently interested in exploring how high is the creative ceiling of curent generation of AI models: AI movie generation, autonomous AI research and long-form AI narrative generation.</p>
